		Placed Q2 cut in right place.
		Scale factors are needed when running the fermi reweighting
		(current solution is to provide weight from script: ric will
		produce already rew weights in future)
030619  -----  Alessio
		Added 3-d weights from Ric in sysWd/ dir.
030619  -----  Alessio
		Fixed once for all the colour PRL convention
		Added DOVARSTU (was missing the reading from file part)
030619  -----  Alessio
		Uploaded a full backward compatible version of fit.
		In order to have old results the fit can be ran
		 without any change. To use new weights use 
		(as before) -W option.
		New variables study has been commented out by default
		Can be turned on by setting the VARSTU env variable to 1.
030609  -----  Alessio
		Tried to reorganize a bit the code in order to minimize
		cutpasting (still a lot of work to do)
		Fit version FULLY compatible with the PRL tag
		(validated against the 'default' result)
		Added 3-d reweighting from Ric.
030430  -----  Alessio
		Added new variables to the fit
		Implemented scan in csi (ciuchini et Al.)
		Implemented fixing for vcb and oth comp
		Implemented fit using q2 distrivution
		Code is growing too much and too repetition are used
		needs optimization (time) instead of cutpasting)

030430  -----  Alessio
                Added new variables and fixed a problem in q2 definition
		I've tested it and works nicely let me know any problem

030217  -----  Alessio
		Added small changes in order to study KL.
		Function for Energy correction is about to be committed.

030217  -----  Alessio
		Fixed inconsistency in sys calling for D decay modes
		reweighting. Now default and sys reweighting is 
		initialized in the proper way.

030208  -----  Alessio
		Included new Theo model. Few pieces of code
		have been added: 
		Theo* stuff: private machinery that deals with
		theoretical problems
		fit* : include of theoretical reweighting. Instructions	
		on how to run the sys will follow by email

030123  -----  Alessio
		Bug Fix: B0 weight was always assigned (also to B+)
		for total semileptonic difference.
		Now the correct sum is taken (B+ no longer change
		changing B0s)

030123  -----  Alessio
		Added code for Theo systematics. The first part is a 
		standalone executable that calculates weights.
		The second part is in the fit structure: I've added
		a function that returns the weight as a function
		of mx bins
		Code has been tested on Linux2/Linux24.

030122  -----  Alessio
		Added chains for newly produced generic MC (~50fb-1)

030121  -----  Alessio
               Bug fix of previous bug fix in
               in charmed semileptonic B decays categorization.
               Now fBVub and fBVcb are correctly defined (no longer 
	       fBVxb is used)

030116  -----  Alessio
               Bug fix in charmed semileptonic B decays categorization.
	       Now all the particles founded as B daughters other from l,nu
	       and ISR photons are called X in B->DXlnu decays and
	       are assigned to category 6.
	       Bug fix is realted to cases were we have 2 B that are
	       semileptonic. Now the vcb or vub is chosen correctly 
	       depending on the study.
  	       Added true charge of B.

020109  -----  Alessio
               Committed code for my studies.....

021219  -----  Silvia 
	       Added categories for charmless exclusive semileptonic channels in mcTruth.icc and a new variable (mxhadchg). The flag  fBVxbTyp (Gvxbtyp in the tree) describes each channel with the convention: 
	      fBVxbTyp = 11       B -> pi l+ nu   
	      fBVxbTyp = 12       B -> eta l+ nu
              fBVxbTyp = 13       B-> rho0 l+ nu
     	      fBVxbTyp = 14       B-> omega l+ nu 
	      fBVxbTyp = 15       B -> eta_prime l+ nu
	      fBVxbTyp = 16       B -> a_10+-,a_20+-,h_1...l nu
	      fBVxbTyp = 17       B -> b_10+- l+ nu
	      fBVxbTyp = 18       B -> f_0, f'_0, f_2...l nu
	      fBVxbTyp = 19       B -> a_00+-...l nu
	      fBVxbTyp = 20       B ->f'_2, h'_1...l nu
	      fBVxbTyp = 21       B -> f_1 l+ nu 
	      fBVxbTyp = 22       B -> f'_1 l+ n
The sign of fBVxbTyp tells if B0 (+) or B+/- (-)

Revision 1.51  2003/02/17 10:46:27  asarti
Small bug fix affecting initialization of sys change of D exclusive weights.
Now the values are well understood.

Revision 1.50  2003/02/08 11:20:03  asarti
Details on changes are in History file. Main issue:
added new model.
The new default is obtained by adding the -Theosys option to the fit call, updating to the -dA in the package (you need the sysWd/refWeights file) and submitting the fit having added in the setting file:
 theomxweight  1
bin0    1

)
The weights are those ones  quoted in the sysWd/refWeights file.
I have various scripts that are submitting jobs in ~asarti/script/sub*
The main one in subVubFit.pl You can see what is my setup in order to submit theoretical reweighted fits.....
Hope that everything is clear. I'll test with daniele the setup and see if any other explanation is needed....

		VubRecoil rf-081302b has two fixes:                        
	        1) the last fix to the 'upper' and 'lower' problem (see recent    
		posting from Daniele and Alessio, was fixed in a way that crashed at run  
		time on Solaris. This has been fixed
	        2) when running on the old files with VubRecoil the overlap with  
		the B reco was not dealt with properly, so that the recoil system was
		including also the reco one. In order to fix this I modified the meaning  
		of the -y option (which meant 'new format'). It now expects an integer    
		argument which represents the production version:
