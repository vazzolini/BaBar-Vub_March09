0) Dependencies
=======================================
You need to have a valid Root installation i.e. with $ROOTSYS configured.

1) Compiling
========================================

This version of "thecomparison" uses shared libraries.
These below are needed to compile libthecomparison.so:

libmesData.so
librecoilAnalysis.so (<- Note: this is not the same library you can build from RecoilAnalysis by running gmake -f Makefile lib !!) 
librecoilDSys.so

To build the shared libraries simply run:

gmake -f Makefile lib

it'll create, compile and link and all the files needed.

2) Running
========================================

Once you have libthecomparison.so you can run thecomparison.
The steps are:

a) Modify settings.dat:
	- file1 and file2 are the names of the files (or chains)
	- tree1 (tree2) is the name of the tree in file1 (file2)
	- outdir is the full path of the dir where postscript filse will be created. If this dir doesn't exist, the program will create it.

	-isbch: B charge: 0= neutral B, 1= charged B, 2 = both   
	-cat:     
	-sys: do B and D reweighting (for MC only!)     
	
	Add the names of variables you wish to compare, providing also the range (min,max) number of bins, shift and smear.

b) Check out if comp.C calls Loop and FitMes methods with appropriate values

c) run compare.pl


3) Options for compare.pl
======================================

-int			interactive mode (by def. it runs in batch mode)
-que <queue name>	specify queue type
-set <filename> 	specify settings file name
-help 			shows help for compare.pl
======================================
