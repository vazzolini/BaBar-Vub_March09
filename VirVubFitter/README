         VubAnalysis -- New Root Code for the Vub Fit analysis 
		     	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

briefly:
at this point of our analysis we need a new Root Code for the Vub Fit that will  approach in a better way the C++like phylosophy, will be probably more compact, ordered and homogenous respect the present one.
It takes place in 2 steps:
first, I tend to reproduce present results with the new fitter;
In a second time it will be possible switch from a variable of interest to whatever other variable.

Today....code development in course!!
